We're almost at the end of the year, and one of the things I love to do in the holiday season is to conduct a personal retrospective of how the past year has been. I don't have a very rigid format for it, but this year I tried to reflect upon: **Things I'm grateful for**, **What went right?**, **What went wrong?**, **Start / Continue Doing**, **Stop Doing**.

After I was done with the fairly enjoyable exercise, I took some time to contemplate what my outlook would be for the next year. Having tried (and failed at) dozens of planning techniques over the course of the past decade that encouraged me to set concrete, specific, short term/long term goals, I have come to the following conclusion.

> The problem with long term goals is that when you eventually get there, you might end up realizing that it's probably not what you wanted in the first place.

In the past year, I went through professional burnout and I was lucky to take my first long break in my career; I had no idea what I would be doing next. During that period of uncertainty, the absence of self-imposed targets dragging me down enabled me to explore what made happy and allowed me to be grounded in the present.

Instead of opting for concrete goals, I felt like I'd be better off working with general themes that I could execute in any way that I see fit. Here's what I've chosen for the next year:

- **Give**: This year made me realize that giving, living generously and looking outwards is incredibly powerful and I'd love to seek out more ways to do that in the coming year.
- **Create**: I love consuming books, podcasts, videos, websites, articles and all the rest of it, but I've not been so great at converting them into ideas and tangible implementations. Something to work towards.
- **Add value**: Closely related to the previous two. I want to be thinking about how I could add value to the people around me, the interactions I have, and to every project that I'm a part of.

The nice part about working with themes instead of concrete goals is that it challenges your value system and encourages you to change the way that you think. If there's too much dissonance, good! Think of it as an opportunity understand yourself better and re-evaluate.

Wishing you a great 2022 ðŸŽ‰!
